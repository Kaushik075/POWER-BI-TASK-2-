# DESCRIPTION 

In this Task, sales data was integrated from two distinct sources—Excel and CSV—to form a cohesive and insightful report. This integration enabled unified analysis across product categories, customer types, and regional distribution. The total sales amounted to 126 million, with 1000 total orders and 500 unique customers. The analysis revealed that the Retail segment contributed 54.75% (69M) of total sales, surpassing Wholesale (45.25%, 57M). Regionally, the West led in sales with slightly above 30 million, closely followed by East and North, while the South trailed marginally. Product-wise, Tablets and Mice emerged as top performers, each generating close to 20M in sales, highlighting demand in portable computing accessories. The Sales Trend graph showed a strong start in January 2023, a dip in February, and a partial recovery in March, indicating possible seasonal or promotional influence.

INSIGHTS :
The successful merging of Excel and CSV data sources into a uniform dashboard has not only streamlined reporting but also revealed meaningful patterns in customer behavior and sales distribution. The integration offered a holistic view across different business dimensions, allowing stakeholders to identify that over half of the revenue (54.75%) comes from retail customers, making them the primary market drivers. The even spread of regional sales emphasizes a balanced market presence, while the monthly trend charts can guide better forecasting and marketing alignment. Ultimately, this integrated data approach enhances decision-making by transforming disparate datasets into actionable business intelligence—exactly meeting the task objective of creating a single, insightful report from multiple sources.
